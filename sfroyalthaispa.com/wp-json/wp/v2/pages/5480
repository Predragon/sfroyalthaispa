The technology behind this is 12 individual valves, which separately control each compression chamber. While developed for lymphatic drainage and rehabilitation\/recovery, the BOA has gained popularity with clients in the U.S. due to its slimming effects on legs and glutes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Benefits include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Speed up recovery of skin after liposuction and cryolipolysis<\/li>\r\n<li>Stop the accumulation of cellulite and fluids<\/li>\r\n<li>Prevent and eliminate varicose in the first stage<\/li>\r\n<li>Shape legs, abdomen, buttocks<\/li>\r\n<li>Strengthen loose skin (post pregnancy\/weight loss)<\/li>\r\n<li>Relieve \u201cheavy legs&#8221;<\/li>\r\n<li>Accelerate recovery from exercise<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Used For:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aesthetic Medicine<\/li>\r\n<li>Sports Medicine<\/li>\r\n<li>Athletic recovery<\/li>\r\n<li>Rehabilitation<\/li>\r\n<li>Cosmetics<\/li>\r\n<li>Wellness<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Compression Therapy Device\u00a0\u201cBOA\u201d decreases water accumulation in the legs through\u00a0lymphatic drainage, making legs thinner while tightening the\u00a0skin and reducing the appearance of cellulite.
